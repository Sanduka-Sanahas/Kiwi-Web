  <h1 id="title">KIWI Bird ((Apteryx mantelli))</h1>
  <p>
    <span class="red-color-paragraph">The word "kiwi" often brings to mind the image of something small,
      brown, fuzzy, and found in the produce section</span>
    of your local supermarket. But the kiwi is not a fruit—that's kiwifruit,
    which is native to eastern Asia! About the size of a chicken, the kiwi is
    a small, flightless, and nearly wingless bird found only in New Zealand.

          <p class="align">
            The kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend to be
            very steep and wet, surrounded by shrubs and trees found nowhere
            else on Earth. Since it is not able to fly up into trees to nest,
            rest, or escape from danger, the kiwi makes its home in burrows in
            the ground of its swampy forest or grassland habitat. The bird
            digs multiple burrows within its territory, using strong toes and
            claws. Nest burrows, dug early in the season, become overgrown at
            the entrance to provide great camouflage by the time the female is
            ready to lay her eggs.
          </p>

            &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFAMILY&nbspLIFE
          </div>
          <p class="align">
            Kiwi pairs use gentle grunts and snuffles with each other and
            their chicks, and males purr during mating. Pairs do fight, and
            the larger female may kick the male away if she is not in the mood
            for his company. If another kiwi invades a pair’s territory, a
            kicking fight ensues, and kiwis have been known to fight to the
            death, although this is rare.
          </p>

          <p class="align">
            An adult male and female kiwi typically pair for life, but a
            female may choose a new male if a more desirable one wanders by.
            The male doesn't have beautiful songs or fancy feathers to attract
            a female. Instead, he follows one around constantly while
            grunting. If she's not interested, the female might wander off or
            try to scare him away. Breeding season is late winter to early
            summer. Nests might be in hollow logs or in underground burrows
            dug by the male.
          </p>

          <p class="align">
            The female kiwi lays up to six eggs every year. Kiwi eggs are
            smooth and white, off-white, or pale green in color. They are also
            huge in comparison to the mother: one egg might reach up to 20
            percent of her weight; that would be like a 120-pound (54
            kilograms) human female giving birth to a 24-pound (11 kilograms)
            baby! Compared to the relative weights of other birds and their
            eggs, the female kiwi should weigh about 31 pounds (14 kilograms)
            rather than its typical weight of 2 to 8 pounds (0.9 to 3.6
            kilograms).
